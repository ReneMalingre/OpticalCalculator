# Optical Calculator

This is a simple HTML file that provides some useful calculators for optometrists. The main calculator in this file is the RGP Power Adjustment calculator, which allows users to calculate the power of a new RGP lens given the power of an existing lens, the base curve of the existing lens, and the desired base curve of the new lens.

## Getting Started

To use this calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The calculator should be displayed in the main content area of the page.

## Usage

To use the RGP Power Adjustment calculator, follow these steps:

Either go to the live page at [renemalingre.github.io/OpticalCalculator/](https://renemalingre.github.io/OpticalCalculator/) or download the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

1. Enter the details of the existing lens in the first section of the form, including the base curve, power, over-refraction, and vertex distance.
2. Enter the desired base curve of the new lens in the second section of the form.
3. The calculator will automatically calculate the new lens power based on the input values and display the result in the third section of the form.

## Features

This HTML file includes the following features:

- A responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- An easy-to-use calculator for RGP lens power adjustment.
